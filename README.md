# importModules
ServiceWorker ES6 Modules Loader

## TL;DR

This lib is loaded into `ServiceWorker` via `importScripts()` and exposes the `importModules()` method.

Your return is based on `Promise()`, use `async` in your `ServiceWorker` events.


```javascript
importScripts(
    'path/to/loader.js'
)

self.addEventListener('install', async event => {
    // most suggestive name, not found
    const Setup = async () => {
        // happiness
        await importModules(
            'import DefautedExportable, { exp1, exp2 as exp3, exp4 } from uri/to/module.js' // complete sintax
        )
        // I know, this is a poor example :)
        return (!!DefaultedExportable) ? Promise.resolve() : Promise.reject()
    }
    
    event.waitUntil(
        Setup()
    )
})
```

What does it do? this search the dependencies in text format (`Fetch()`), parse the import instructions to encapsulate the imported script in an **IIEF** function ... inject the dependencies with their respective alias, namespaces and renames to the local scope (`self`) with `eval()`

**see "warn" section bellow**



## Limitations:

* it doesn't matter sub dependencies
* does not work with cyclicality modules
* it is not cached. for being stored only in memory, after the device restarts or the browser process is terminated, the reference to modules is lost



## Todo:

- [ ] improve `RegExp` rules
- [ ] save raw scripts into `IndexedDB` to "recharge" modules reference at memory
- [ ] import sub dependencies
- [ ] more ...



## Warn:

This project is a "case study"/"proof of concept", it is unstable and under development while the native solution of ES6 modules for `ServiceWorker` does not land on browsers

**You not should**:

* **do not use in production (at least, not yet)**
* **do not import third party scripts into your application**
